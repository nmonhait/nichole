<p>Hi there! My name is Nichole and I am a Sr. Enterprise Advocate @ RStudio PBC. In 2019, I received my MPH from the Colorado School of Public Health where I studied Epidemiology and fell in love with programming in R. I’d love to see R use grow within public health, which is why I created this blogdown site. My subject area interests include LGBTQ health, mental health, and substance use, so you will likely see many of these small projects utilize data from these areas. Feel free to reach out to me any time, I’d love to chat.</p>
<p>If you’d like to help keep me caffeinated for these fun data projects, feel free to sponsor a cup of ☕ <a href="https://ko-fi.com/nicholemonhait">here</a>! Thanks for visiting, I appreciate you!</p>
